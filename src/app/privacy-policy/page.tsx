        Our website uses cookies. Your acceptance of these terms by using this
        website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as
        set out in this privacy and cookie policy. If we change our privacy and

        <H2>About Cookies</H2>
        <p>
          A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
          numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by
          the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time
          the browser requests a page from the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they
          navigate different pages on a website and to identify users returning
          to a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A
          persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a
          web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid
          until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the
          expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
          end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

        <H3>How we use your personal data</H3>
        <p>
          We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we have
          collected it. If we need to process your personal data for a different
          purpose that is not compatible with the original purpose that we
          collected your personal data, we will let you know.

        <H3>Data security</H3>
        <p>
          Once we have received your personal data we will use reasonable and
          necessary procedures and security features to try and prevent
          unauthorised access. For example, we limit who can access your
          personal data to those individuals and third parties who need to know
          it and who are subject to a duty of confidentiality. If we become
          aware of a data breach we will notify the Information Commissioner’s
          Office. If we believe that the data breach is serious, we may notify
          you in accordance with our legal requirements.

          The rights listed above may apply in certain circumstances, and so we
          may not always be able to comply with your request to exercise these
          rights. We will usually respond to a request from you to exercise your
          rights within 1 month of receipt, but it might take longer if your
          request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of
          requests. Please be aware that we may need to process your personal
          data and/or request specific information from you to help us comply
          with your request. You will not usually have to pay a fee to exercise
          these rights, but we reserve the right to if your request is clearly
          unfounded, repetitive or excessive, alternatively we may refuse to
          comply with your request.
